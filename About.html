        About Us
        

    </h1>

    <p class="head1">

        As one of the oldest universities of the country, Jadavpur University, and its students have a certain duty -
        the duty to give back to society across all disciplines and inculcate the habit of thinking in every individual
        who comes along. The IEEE Jadavpur University Student Branch is one little endeavor in that process. Founded in
        2010, we belong to the Kolkata section of Region 10 of the organization. One of the most active student branches
        in our section, we are dedicated to furthering technical and entrepreneurial innovations through hands-on
        interactive sessions. With large scale events and intimate, basic workshops, we try to keep something happening
        all year round - so that the fire of knowledge, learning and innovation never burns out. In this process of
        sharing our love for technology, we have slowly grown, met new people, evolved as a group and built around us, a
        community of like-minded individuals who are driven by a passion for learning and giving back to society.
